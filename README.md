## History
The Royal Game of Ur is a two-player strategy race board game of the tables family that was first played in ancient Mesopotamia during the early third millennium BC.

## General rules and Objective
It is generally agreed that the Royal game of Ur is a race game - the aim is to get all 7 pieces around the board to the finish point first.

Throw the dice to decide who plays first - highest score goes first, if it's a draw, throw again.

Players take turns to throw three binary lots and move one of their pieces.

Only one piece may be moved per throw of the dice and pieces must always move forward around the track.

If a counter lands upon a square occupied by an opposing counter, the counter landed upon is sent off the board and must start again from the beginning.
